after drawing the structure we get an idea for how to build an website like(for upper menu,logo present in the website).
-> In that planning we assume first is menu bar in your application and after that we have to place an image in that,
and next we have to define the size and shape ,paste it in all and place title in that images[Movie Name] like Vettaiyan,
Indian2 etc. when we click this Movie we have to go another webpage for which theatre,seat booking,payments these are
the sites we have to plan to build a (website).
-> for more reference we have to check the other website (how the structure build)?
-> Take a BookMyShow website this is the final version of the building website.

today we are going to see how to do menuBar in BookMyShow Website?
Using {BootStrap} we are going to menuBar in website.
--> In Bootstrap we are going to use the concept of CSS[Cascading Style Sheet].
what is mean by cascading Style Sheet?
Ans: assume we are writing a Book and this Book Consist Of 500pages in these heading The Font size is 15px
we have to change the font size from 15px --> 18px in these it is difficult to change each time to change the size
so we have to define the constant value in this we change, automatically it will reflect all sections present in the 
website. for this thing we are using [CSS].
-->CSS have Frameworks which have some readymate Frameworks present in the website is known as [BootStrap]
-->using this framework our websites are easily to develop fastly and we avoid coding inch by inch.
--> Let's Going to see How to take a BootStrap
--> we don't need to download the BootstrapDocument and there is a Feature Called [Content Delivery Network].
-->Copy The Link And Paste In Your [Index.html]. and the location in Bootstrap is [Downloads/CDNvisjsDeliver/FirstLink(Upto style = "relsheet")].
--> For Recreating the menuBar We are using some Tags like <H1> etc. in the [Index.html]
<nav> bar,which i am giving an class,<nav class = "navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark" style = "background-color: #333(black)"> </nav>
the nav,nav bar,nav expand which comes from bootstrap framework. in the docmentation.
--> after putting navbar we have create a div tag and put class name = "container" to full fill the content in this div tag.
--> next we put an anchor tag and put <a class ="navbar-brand" href="#" style="color: #f84464 !important; font-weight: bold;">bookMyshow</a>
--> Next we have to create a button which is responsible to the [bookmyshow name].
<button class = "navbar-toggler" type = "button" data-bs-toggle ="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav"> 
<span class = "navbar-toggler-icon"></span> 
-->for creating the menus we have to put the tags <ul> and <li> and put it in the <div> tag which is
<div class = "collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav"> inside this we put <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto"> inside this
<li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#" style="color: #fff !important;">Movies</a></li></ul>
--> Next we have to create a search bar and search button for this, we have to use form tag.
<form class="d-flex"> <input type="search" class="form-control me-2" placeholder="Search for Movies, Events, Plays">
next we have to create button for this we use,
<button class="btn btn-outline-light" type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
--> Next Thing we are going to do this The Particular Card
below the form and nav bar we can put card use div put class = container mt-4
<div class ="container mt-4"> inside this we should put 
<div id = "movieCards" class="row"></div>
we are going to use JAVASCRIPT how to create a card with an dynamic outcome.
we can use div tag
<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 mb-4">
Assume that there is a row in this cards present the total row width is 12 in this we split into a s 4 cards
so the total width of a col is 3 so we put [col-lg-3] in the <div> tag.
[col-md-4] --> when the screen size is medium each card occupies Four Columns.
[col-sm-6] --> when the screen size is small each card occupies Six Columns.
[mb-4] --> each card occupies 4 spaces.
Next we have to another div class and also put style.
<div class="card" style="cursor: pointer;">
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title"> Indian 2</h5>
<p class="card-text"> Drama</p>
</div>
</div>
i'm going to duplicates this 4 times and it consist of 4 with a uniform order in the row.
in this we are giving class name to card and style ="cursor": pointer;--> when the mouse is going to card and it converts from arrow
to hand.
next we have to do image tag with source simple placed as placeholder image.
we have to use a div tag and put class ="card-body" below the card we have to put <h5> tag in title and also put <p>
tag to define movie name and also which type of journer.
-->Next we are going to use footer tag to specify their address,retail etc.
<footer class="text-center text-lg-start bg-body-tertiary text-muted mt-4">
<section class="d-flex justify-content-center justify-content-lg-between p-4 border-bottom">
<section>
<div class="container text-center text-md-start mt-5">
<div class="row mt-3">
<!-- Grid Column -->
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-xl-3 mx-auto mb-4">

<!-- Copyright -->
</footer>
Due to this footer tag inside the section is created in that we generate bookMyShow company details like Email,Phone number and 
also fixing the size of the section as per grid column and also generating class as multiple names in the <div> and <section> tag    

--> Next Step we have to push this source code into github.
what is mean by github?
Ans: Github is an version control system, it means that we are writing the document for 10 days. when writing unfortunately First day content of
the content has [forgot/deleted] it is not possible to retrieve first day content because the content is deleted.
but version control system is not like that whaen we write each time the document and save that each time for example you save 10 times
you get 10 saved file you read any file as you wish.
--> go to github and create a repository named [Learn-with-guvi-book-my-show]
when we create an empty repository we get three types of link.
